                        Tokyo DisneySea is a fantasy theme park in Tokyo Disney Resort that is unique to Japan. Inspired
                        by the myths and legends of the sea, Tokyo DisneySea is made up of eight themed ports of call:
                        Mediterranean Harbor, Mysterious Island, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, Lost River Delta, Port
                        Discovery, American Waterfront and Fantasy Springs.

                        While suitable for all ages, Tokyo DisneySea was designed to specifically also appeal to a more
                        grown up audience. The park addresses the Japanese visitors' strong interest in good food by
                        providing a wider selection of table service restaurants than Tokyo Disneyland.

                        Mt. Fuji is perhaps one of the most iconic symbols of Japan. It has incredible spiritual,
                        natural, and cultural significance, and is a UNESCO Heritage Site. Many tourists flock from
                        around Japan and abroad in hopes of climbing Japan’s highest mountain during the summer months.
                        However, if you go to Shizuoka Prefecture, you may also have the chance to see Mt. Fuji from a
                        different perspective―high up in the sky.

                        At a maid cafe, service goes beyond delivering drinks and desserts. Maids often perform small
                        gestures or “spells” to “enhance” your meal(many of which were born in at-home cafe) and engage
                        you in a way that feels personal and fun. The goal is to create an atmosphere of warmth, where
                        everyone—from families with children to solo travelers—can relax, laugh, and enjoy a unique
                        cultural experience they won’t soon forget.

                        There are countless local festivals (祭り, matsuri) in Japan because almost every shrine
                        celebrates one of its own. Most festivals are held annually and celebrate the shrine's deity or
                        a seasonal or historical event.
                        Many festivals also feature decorated floats (known regionally under various names, such as
                        dashi, yatai, danjiri, etc.), which are paraded through the town, accompanied by drum and flute
                        music by the people sitting on the floats. Every festival has its own characteristics. While
                        some festivals are calm and meditative, many are energetic and noisy.

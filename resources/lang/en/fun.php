                        Mediterranean Harbor, Mysterious Island, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, Lost River Delta, Port
                        Discovery, American Waterfront and Fantasy Springs.

                        While suitable for all ages, Tokyo DisneySea was designed to specifically also appeal to a more
                        grown up audience. The park addresses the Japanese visitors strong interest in good food by
